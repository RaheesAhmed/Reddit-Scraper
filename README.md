# Reddit Data Collection and Parsing

## Introduction
This Python script demonstrates how to collect data from Reddit using the Reddit API and parse it to extract relevant information from the fetched data.

## Prerequisites
To run this script, you need to have the `requests` library installed. If you don't have it, you can install it using `pip`:


## How to Use
1. Obtain a Reddit API key by creating a developer account on Reddit.
2. Replace `'YOUR_REDDIT_API_KEY'` with your actual Reddit API key in the code.
3. Replace the `subreddit` variable with the subreddit of your choice.
4. Set the `num_posts` variable to the number of top posts you want to retrieve from that subreddit.

## Code Explanation
- The `get_reddit_data(subreddit, num_posts)` function fetches data from the Reddit API for the specified subreddit and number of posts.
- The `parse_reddit_data(data)` function extracts relevant information from the fetched data.
- The script then calls these functions and prints the extracted information.

## Example Usage
```python
import requests

# Paste the provided code here

subreddit = "Python"  # Replace this with the subreddit of your choice
num_posts = 10        # Number of posts to retrieve

data = get_reddit_data(subreddit, num_posts)
if data:
    parsed_data = parse_reddit_data(data)
    print(parsed_data)
```
Please make sure to follow Reddit's API usage guidelines and respect the terms of use when using the Reddit API for data collection. Additionally, consider the ethical implications of working with user-generated content and handle the data responsibly and with respect for user privacy.
